1- How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I build software with these attributes in mind by evaluating each application or aim I have for the software. If I'm certain I'll be using software for something else in the not-too-distant future, I'm going to render it as simple to grasp and adaptive as possible. The benefits of this for the Python CRUD component were that it proved easily expandable for subsequent modules in which we utilized it. I might employ this module to connect to any other MongoDB installation I might end up utilizing.

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I tackle challenges in a systematic and analytical manner. I did my best to grasp Grazioso Salvare's demands and figure out precisely what he was looking for, as well as what I would have to do to execute those modifications. This is different from prior courses since I am not normally this detailed or exact. In the not-too-distant future, I'm going to most likely use these techniques of creating and collecting data from datasets to add value to my client's product.

3- What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company like Grazioso Salvare do their work better?

Scientists working with computers design and create solutions that use computers to improve or simplify processes with the goal of achieving maximum work productivity. This is significant since computer scientists' work drives efficiency and allows us to analyze data in ways never before imaginable by using the power of machines. My involvement in these types of projects could help businesses do their jobs more effectively by giving them more knowledge about their company's procedures or optimizing their company workflows to maximize productivity and, thus, revenues.
